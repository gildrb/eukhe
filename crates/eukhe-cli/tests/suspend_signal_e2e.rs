//! Real-signal e2e for the `app.suspend` cycle (TS `handleCtrlZ`): the
//! product's terminal renderer runs on a pty in a child process group,
//! and the harness drives the signal path a shell exercises.
//!
//! The TS shield window (SIGINT ignored while suspended) is covered by
//! the eukhe-types unit test on the disposition pair; it cannot be e2e'd
//! here: a SIGINT sent to a *stopped* process queues until SIGCONT and is
//! delivered while the app already restored the default disposition
//! mid-resume, which destabilizes the terminal reader in this harness —
//! and a real shell cannot produce that sequence anyway (Ctrl+C goes to
//! the shell, the foreground process; the suspended app is background).
//!
//! Two harness details keep the child deterministic (found the hard way):
//! the child is in its own
//! process group inside this runner's session (its terminal is the
//! harness pty alone), and the SIGINT-while-stopped
//! test is separate — a SIGINT sent to a *stopped* process queues until
//! SIGCONT and is delivered when the app already restored the default
//! disposition mid-resume, which destabilizes the terminal reader; a
//! real shell cannot produce that (Ctrl+C goes to the shell, the
//! foreground process), so the byte-level assertions run without it.
