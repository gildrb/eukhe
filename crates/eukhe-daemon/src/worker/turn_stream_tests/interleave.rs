//! The interleave harness (the passivation lane's named follow-up from the
//! nine-round bar): the race windows between concurrent lifecycle events —
//! the class every fresh bot pass found a new instance of (the round-1
//! concurrent-wake join, the round-5 departure release, the round-6
//! post-await windows, the round-7 compacting/attach revalidation, the
//! round-8 shutdown/admission and attach/close orders, the round-9 token
//! lifecycle) — pinned as tests, so the class is closed by construction,
//! not by the next bot pass.
//!
//! THE HARNESS CONTRACT (the abort-idle-race lane's rate-harness precedents,
//! made deterministic):
//! - THE DIRECT-DRIVE FIRE: the raced window lives inside
//!   [`TurnRunner::maybe_request_idle_passivation`] — the engine gate's
//!   await, between the fresh-snapshot fence and the post-await
//!   revalidation. The harness drives THAT path directly (the same
//!   discipline the product's own e2e uses: `idle_passivation_e2e.rs`
//!   drives the worker->supervisor passivation request directly so the
//!   e2e stays gate-fast). The park->window->timer leg cannot be driven
//!   deterministically: the park arm re-stamps `last_activity_ms` from
//!   `SystemTime` and the fire's fresh-clock gate re-checks the same wall
//!   clock, so no in-process clock fake can carry the fire past its own
//!   gate (and `idleEvictionMinutes: 0` is not a zero threshold — the
//!   settings grammar falls back to the default). The timer leg stays
//!   pinned at rest by the park family's window battery; this harness
//!   pins the RACE — the events landing while the fire holds.
//! - PROBE-TRUE-AT-THE-SEAM: every raced test parks the fire at a
//!   PROVABLE point before landing the racing event — the fire holds
//!   inside the engine gate's await (the [`GateHoldEngine`] seam, the
//!   exact window the post-await revalidation covers), reached exactly
//!   once (the gate counter). The racing event never lands blind.
//! - THE JOIN BARRIER: the settle is the fire task's own join — the
//!   raced continuation (the post-await revalidation, the ask) runs to
//!   completion before any assertion reads the transcript. No test
//!   sleeps; no assertion reads a wall latency.
//! - THE TRANSCRIPT ASSERTION: the settled state names the winner —
//!   the recording supervisor probe OBSERVES the ask as the exact
//!   command the product sends (`worker_idle_passivation` with the
//!   worker token and the threshold), never inferred from a side
//!   effect (the served-path oracle, the `window_serves` pattern: an
//!   oracle that cannot prove the request left is vacuous exactly
//!   where it matters).
//! - THE SERVED-PATH PAIRING: every cancel arm shares the positive
//!   arm's fixture, so a broken harness (a link that never answers, a
//!   gate that never releases) fails the positive arm first — the
//!   cancel arms cannot green themselves by never asking.
//!
//! THE PINS (the nine rounds' windows, each named by the round that found
//! it, plus the two residual windows the harness itself found — the lane's
//! product fixes):
//! - THE POST-AWAIT REVALIDATION (rounds 6/7/9): a client attaching, lane
//!   work parking, a manual compaction starting, an input suspension
//!   engaging, a user bash admitted, or a shutdown starting WHILE the fire
//!   holds at the engine gate each cancel the stop and keep the racing
//!   work intact. The shutdown arm is the harness's residual finding: the
//!   round-9 "uniform predicate set" claim did not hold at the post-await
//!   site (the arm ships with the harness).
//! - THE SHUTDOWN'S BASH ADMISSION (rounds 7/8): a bash dispatched while
//!   the stop is closing is refused ("Session is shutting down"), and a
//!   bash admitted before the stop is aborted by it (the settled run
//!   reports cancelled).
//! - THE ATTACH/CLOSE TOKEN LIFECYCLE (rounds 8/9): both orders pinned —
//!   the close beating the detached handler's registration leaves no
//!   unowned hold (the harness's residual finding: the round-8 belt
//!   closed the registry entry but the core retain was still ungated; the
//!   retain now rides the registration's verdict), the registration
//!   beating the close releases cleanly, the non-final detach re-registers,
//!   the shared client id survives one connection's close, the
//!   released-token set caps.
//!
//! DISCLOSED COVERAGE: the input-pause lease arm of the suspension gates
//! shares the window/fence predicate with `queued_input_suspended` (one
//! `||` term at every site); the pause table's lease arms are not
//! runner-seizable in-crate, so the arm stays covered at rest by the park
//! family's predicate-set test. The timer leg (the park loop's sleep to
//! the threshold) is wall-clock-bound by design and stays pinned at rest
//! by the park family's window battery plus the product's real-time
//! coverage. The departure release (a closed connection's release
//! re-arming the window) is the park family's window battery too. The
//! gate-before-abort ORDER inside `handle_shutdown` (one critical section
//! sets `shutdown_requested` before `user_bash.abort()` runs) has no seam
//! a test can hold between the two steps, so no test here pins it - the
//! tests pin each step's effect. The base's `UserBash` open corners (the single-slot overlap,
//! the forked-grandchild survival) are TS-anchored follow-ups on the
//! base's bash surface — out of this lane's scope (the round-9 rebuttal
//! carries them).
// Unix-only: the probe harness stands in for the supervisor side of
// the passivation ask over a real unix domain socket
// (tokio::net::UnixListener), which has no counterpart on the windows
// target.
