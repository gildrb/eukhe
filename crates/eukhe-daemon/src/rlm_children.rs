//! Supervisor-backed RLM child sessions: the daemon's implementation of the
//! eukhe-core [`RlmSubagentHost`] seam. `rlm.spawn` and `rlm.create_session`
//! create real daemon sessions through the supervisor link (one supervised
//! worker process per child), prompt them, and keep the parent-side roster
//! the kernel reads through `rlm.list_subagents`, `rlm.collect`, and
//! `rlm.delete_subagent`.
//!
//! Mechanism note: the TS daemon hosts children in-process
//! (`createRlmSubagentRuntime`); this redesign gives every child its own
//! supervised worker process, created through the supervisor like any other
//! session. The kernel-visible surface (handles, roster rows, collect
//! snapshots, selector errors) is TS parity.
