//! The built-in Herdr connector: session-scoped pane state reporting.
//!
//! Herdr (<https://herdr.dev>) is a terminal workspace manager: it owns
//! panes and exports the pane's identity in the environment
//! (`HERDR_ENV=1`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` — the socket of
//! its pane-state API) for the processes running inside them. This module
//! reports this session's lifecycle state (`working` / `blocked` /
//! `idle`) to that socket, so a Herdr pane shows its Eukhe session
//! as live, done, or stuck — the in-tree counterpart of the TS
//! `herdr-agent-state.ts` extension (`herdr integration install pi` also
//! writes one; the built-in ships so the pane reports out of the box).
//!
//! Session-scoped by construction, not by boot context: the pane
//! identity never comes from this process's ambient environment. The
//! client that owns the pane sends the allowlisted `HERDR_*` vars on the
//! session `create` (TS `DAEMON_CLIENT_ENV_KEYS`), the supervisor rides
//! them on the worker's durable create command, and the worker resolves
//! them from the create payload here. Every session is its own worker
//! process, so its reporter owns its pane alone: a daemon (supervisor)
//! booted outside Herdr, or in one Herdr tab, cannot bleed its boot
//! context into sessions later created in other panes — the TS bug
//! class this port does not reproduce.
//!
//! The wire contract (one JSON line per request, closed after the first
//! response byte, an error, or 500 ms):
//!
//! ```json
//! {"id":"herdr:pi:<ms>:<rand>","method":"pane.report_agent","params":{"pane_id":"<HERDR_PANE_ID>","source":"herdr:pi","agent":"eukhe","state":"working","seq":1780000000000000,"agent_session_path":"/home/me/.eukhe/sessions/<id>.jsonl"}}
//! {"id":"herdr:pi:release:<ms>:<rand>","method":"pane.release_agent","params":{"pane_id":"…","source":"herdr:pi","agent":"eukhe","seq":1780000000000001}}
//! ```
//!
//! `message` rides only blocked reports. `seq` is per-process monotonic
//! (seeded `now_ms * 1000`; a successor reporter after a session
//! replacement never restarts below a used value — Herdr drops
//! lower-seq reports per source, which would stick a pane at working).
