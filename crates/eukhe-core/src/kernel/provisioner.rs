//! The per-session kernel provisioner: owns one kernel manager, guards its
//! startup, revives the saved namespace before the runtime bootstrap, and
//! disposes/kills on demand.
//!
//! Teardown contract: the provisioner is the manager's strong owner, and the
//! manager's reader/watcher tasks hold only weak references — so dropping the
//! last provisioner handle tears the kernel PROCESS down synchronously
//! (`Inner::drop` sends the kill). An explicit `dispose()` is still the
//! product path (it flushes a final namespace snapshot first), but no kernel
//! can outlive the object graph that created it.
//!
//! Ported from `core/tools/ipython.ts` (`IpythonKernelProvisioner`) and
//! `core/kernel/boot-gate.ts`.
