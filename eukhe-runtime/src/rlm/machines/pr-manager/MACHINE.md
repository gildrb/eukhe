# pr-manager

## What this machine does

Drives a pull request through review and fix cycles. One entry child
resolves the pull request URL, a reviewer child judges the diff, and a
fixer child addresses the findings; the guarded loop alternates until the
verdict approves or the bounded re-entries run out, then a resident
watcher stays available for follow-ups.

This is the machine-form example: guarded transitions select the next
state (`approved` true or false), `max_entries` bounds each loop state,
the fixer's `fix_report` is an optional input on the reviewer's next
re-entry (it binds only after the fixer settled at least once), and
`monitoring` uses the `resident` lifecycle so its instance stays alive
after approval instead of ending the run.

## How to run it

    result = await rlm.factory.run("pr-manager")

Then watch progress with `await rlm.factory.status(result["run_id"])`.
The alternation count is bounded by `max_transitions` and by each loop
state's `max_entries`; the run pauses (escalates) instead of spinning.
