# review-sweep

## What this machine does

Sweeps the current branch for review findings. One source child lists the
changed files, a reviewer child reviews each file in parallel (up to eight
at a time), and one aggregator child merges the per-file verdicts into a
single issue list.

The review state is a `foreach`: the `files` input (a JSON list) expands to
one reviewer instance per changed file (the `foreach.max` cap of 256 only
bounds pathological diffs; `run.max_parallel: 8` is what bounds how many
reviewers run at once), and every reviewer's one-line verdict joins into
the `found` text port the aggregator reads.

## How to run it

Store a copy of this machine as a runtime instance and run it, or run the
template directly from the library:

    result = await rlm.factory.run("review-sweep")

Then watch progress with `await rlm.factory.status(result["run_id"])`. The
run finishes at quiescence; the aggregator's `issues` JSON is the latest
settle answer of the `report` state.
