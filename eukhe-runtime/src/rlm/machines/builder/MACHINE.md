# builder

## What this machine does

Builds a documented status report from parallel section writers. One source
child inspects the working tree and produces a short outline, one writer
child drafts a section per outline line (up to eight in parallel), and a
collector child assembles the sections into a single markdown report.

This is the fan-in example: `collect` waits on the joined `sections` text
port until every writer settles, then merges them. No guards, no loops -
the simplest multi-child shape the factory runs.

## How to run it

    result = await rlm.factory.run("builder")

Then watch progress with `await rlm.factory.status(result["run_id"])`. The
collector's `merged` text is the latest settle answer of the `collect`
state.
